# Introduction to NumPy: Code Examples

This repository contains simple Python code examples introducing key concepts and functionalities of the NumPy library. NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

The code snippets in this repository serve as a hands-on guide to get started with NumPy basics.

## Topics Covered

The examples demonstrate how to perform various operations using NumPy, including:

*   **Installation and Import**: Shows how to install NumPy and import it [1].
*   **Array Creation**: Creating NumPy arrays from Python lists [1, 2].
*   **Array Properties**: Examining properties of arrays such as dimension (`ndim`), shape (`shape`), size (`size`), and data type (`dtype`) [1, 2].
*   **Array Reshaping**: Changing the shape of an array [2, 3].
*   **Indexing and Slicing**: Accessing and extracting elements from arrays, noting its similarity to Python lists [3].
*   **Creating Special Arrays**: Generating arrays of zeros (`np.zeros`) [3], ones (`np.ones`) [3], sequences within a range (`np.arange`) [3], and evenly spaced values (`np.linspace`) [4].
*   **Array Sorting**: Sorting elements within an array [4].
*   **Array Concatenation**: Joining arrays together [4].
*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Performing element-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication between arrays [5].
*   **Aggregate Functions**: Calculating the sum (`sum()`), minimum (`min()`), maximum (`max()`), and mean (`mean()`) of array elements [5].
*   **Broadcasting**: Demonstrating how NumPy handles operations between arrays of different shapes, such as multiplying an array by a scalar [5].
*   **Filtering with Boolean Indexing**: Selecting array elements based on conditions [6].
*   **Saving and Loading Arrays**: How to save NumPy arrays to binary files (`.npy`) and text/CSV files (`.csv`) and load them back [7, 8].

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and NumPy installed.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6+
*   NumPy

### Installation

You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
The sources show an example of installing NumPy using !pip install numpy, commonly used in environments like Colab or Jupyter notebooks.
How to Run the Code
The code examples are likely in a single file (e.g., a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook).
•
If it's a Python script (.py): You can run it directly from your terminal:
•
If it's a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb): You can open and run it cell by cell using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.
Structure
(If you have multiple files, briefly describe the structure here. If it's just one file, you can mention its name, e.g., numpy_introduction.ipynb or numpy_examples.py)
