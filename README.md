# Data Analysis with Python:

## Introduction

Welcome to `yuvateja3400/Data-Analysis`! This repository serves as a **collection of my practical work and learning efforts in data analysis using Python**. It contains **Python code examples** [1] designed to explore foundational concepts and functionalities essential for data manipulation, numerical computing, and basic visualisation. My focus has been on understanding core libraries and working through various exercises, which effectively showcases hands-on skills in data analysis.

## Key Technologies & Libraries Used

This work primarily utilises the following Python libraries:

*   **Python**: All code is designed for **Python 3.6+** [2].
*   **NumPy**: As a **fundamental package for scientific computing in Python**, NumPy provides robust support for **large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices** and a **large collection of high-level mathematical functions** [1]. My work extensively covers NumPy basics [1].
*   **Pandas**: As evidenced by files like `Data_Analysis_with_Pandas_Part1.ipynb` and `Pandas_Exercises.ipynb` [3], this repository includes work on **Pandas for data manipulation and analysis**, especially with tabular data structures like DataFrames.
*   **Matplotlib**: The `Matplotlib_Part_1.ipynb` file [3] indicates an exploration of **Matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualisations** in Python.

## Topics Covered & Learning Outcomes

This repository systematically explores several key areas of data analysis:

### **NumPy Fundamentals**

The code snippets and exercises provide a practical introduction to NumPy, demonstrating how to perform various operations, including:

*   **Installation and Import**: How to install NumPy and import it [4].
*   **Array Creation**: Creating NumPy arrays from Python lists [4].
*   **Array Properties**: Examining properties such as dimension (`ndim`), shape (`shape`), size (`size`), and data type (`dtype`) [4].
*   **Array Reshaping**: Changing the shape of an array [4].
*   **Indexing and Slicing**: Accessing and extracting elements from arrays, similar to Python lists [4].
*   **Creating Special Arrays**: Generating arrays of zeros (`np.zeros`), ones (`np.ones`), sequences within a range (`np.arange`), and evenly spaced values (`np.linspace`) [4].
*   **Array Sorting**: Sorting elements within an array [4].
*   **Array Concatenation**: Joining arrays together [4].
*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Performing element-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication between arrays [4].
*   **Aggregate Functions**: Calculating the sum (`sum()`), minimum (`min()`), maximum (`max()`), and mean (`mean()`) of array elements [4].
*   **Broadcasting**: Demonstrating how NumPy handles operations between arrays of different shapes [4].
*   **Filtering with Boolean Indexing**: Selecting array elements based on conditions [4].
*   **Saving and Loading Arrays**: How to save NumPy arrays to binary (`.npy`) and text/CSV (`.csv`) files, and load them back [4].

### **Pandas for Data Manipulation**

Through dedicated notebooks, this repository delves into using Pandas for crucial data manipulation tasks.

### **Matplotlib for Data Visualisation**

The included Matplotlib notebook introduces fundamental concepts for creating various types of plots and visualising data effectively.

## Repository Structure & Contents

The repository is organised into several Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) and other essential files [3]:

*   `Data_Analysis_with_Pandas_Part1.ipynb`
*   `Exercises_Numpy.ipynb`
*   `Introduction_to_Numpy.ipynb`
*   `Introduction_to_Numpy_2.ipynb`

My Learning Journey
This repository represents my dedicated effort to build a strong foundation in data analysis using Python. Through these exercises and hands-on coding, I have gained practical experience in core data manipulation techniques, numerical operations, and fundamental data visualisation, all of which are essential skills for any data-focused role. This collection of my work allowed me to solidify my understanding of how Python's powerful ecosystem, particularly NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, can be effectively leveraged for data exploration and analysis.
