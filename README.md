# Data Analysis with Python

## Introduction

This repository, **`yuvateja3400/Data-Analysis`**, serves as a **hands-on guide to foundational concepts and functionalities for data analysis using Python** [4]. It contains **simple Python code examples** designed to introduce key libraries essential for scientific computing and data manipulation [4]. The focus of this project has been on learning core concepts and libraries, alongside working through various exercises, which effectively demonstrates practical skills in data analysis [Conversation History]. The project is titled "Data Analysis with Python" [1, 3, 4].

## Key Technologies & Libraries Used

This project primarily utilises the following Python libraries:

*   **Python**: The code is designed for **Python 3.6+** [5].
*   **NumPy**: A **fundamental package for scientific computing in Python** [4]. It provides robust support for **large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices**, along with a **large collection of high-level mathematical functions** to operate on these arrays [4].
*   **Pandas**: The presence of `Data_Analysis_with_Pandas_Part1.ipynb` and `Pandas_Exercises.ipynb` [2] indicates a focus on **Pandas for data manipulation and analysis**, particularly with tabular data structures like DataFrames [Conversation History].
*   **Matplotlib**: The `Matplotlib_Part_1.ipynb` file [2] suggests an exploration of **Matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualisations** in Python [Conversation History].

## Topics Covered & Learning Outcomes

This repository systematically explores several key areas of data analysis:

### **NumPy Fundamentals**

The code snippets and exercises provide a hands-on introduction to NumPy basics, demonstrating how to perform various operations, including:

*   **Installation and Import**: Shows how to install NumPy and import it [6].
*   **Array Creation**: Creating NumPy arrays from Python lists [6].
*   **Array Properties**: Examining properties of arrays such as dimension (`ndim`), shape (`shape`), size (`size`), and data type (`dtype`) [6].
*   **Array Reshaping**: Changing the shape of an array [6].
*   **Indexing and Slicing**: Accessing and extracting elements from arrays, noting its similarity to Python lists [6].
*   **Creating Special Arrays**: Generating arrays of zeros (`np.zeros`) [6], ones (`np.ones`) [6], sequences within a range (`np.arange`) [6], and evenly spaced values (`np.linspace`) [6].
*   **Array Sorting**: Sorting elements within an array [6].
*   **Array Concatenation**: Joining arrays together [6].
*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Performing element-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication between arrays [6].
*   **Aggregate Functions**: Calculating the sum (`sum()`), minimum (`min()`), maximum (`max()`), and mean (`mean()`) of array elements [6].
*   **Broadcasting**: Demonstrating how NumPy handles operations between arrays of different shapes, such as multiplying an array by a scalar [6].
*   **Filtering with Boolean Indexing**: Selecting array elements based on conditions [6].
*   **Saving and Loading Arrays**: How to save NumPy arrays to binary files (`.npy`) and text/CSV files (`.csv`) and load them back [6].

### **Pandas for Data Manipulation**

Through dedicated notebooks [2], this repository delves into using Pandas for [Conversation History]:

*   **Data Structures**: Working with DataFrames and Series.
*   **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.
*   **Data Selection and Filtering**: Using various methods to select and filter data.
*   **Data Aggregation and Grouping**: Performing operations like grouping by columns and applying aggregate functions.

### **Matplotlib for Data Visualisation**

The included Matplotlib notebook [2] introduces [Conversation History]:

*   **Basic Plotting**: Creating fundamental plots such as line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts.
*   **Customisation**: Customising plot elements like titles, labels, colours, and styles.

## Repository Structure & Contents

The repository is organised into several Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) and other essential files [2]:

*   `Data_Analysis_with_Pandas_Part1.ipynb` [2]
*   `Exercises_Numpy.ipynb` [2]
*   `Introduction_to_Numpy.ipynb` [2]
*   `Introduction_to_Numpy_2.ipynb` [2]
*   `LICENSE` [2]
*   `Matplotlib_Part_1.ipynb` [2]
*   `Pandas_Exercises.ipynb` [2]
*   `README.md` [2]

## Getting Started

To run the code examples and exercises in this repository, please follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites**
